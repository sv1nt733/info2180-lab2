            <p>Generating random paragraphs can be an excellent way for writers to get their creative flow going at the beginning of the day. 
                The writer has no idea what topic the random paragraph will be about when it appears. 
                This forces the writer to use creativity to complete one of three common writing challenges. 
                The writer can use the paragraph as the first one of a short story and build upon it.
                A second option is to use the random paragraph somewhere in a short story they create. 
                The third option is to have the random paragraph be the ending paragraph in a short story.
                No matter which of these challenges is undertaken, the writer is forced to use creativity to incorporate the paragraph into their writing.

               They argue. While the argument seems to be different the truth is it's always the same. 
               Yes, the topic may be different or the circumstances, but when all said and done, it all came back to the same thing. 
               They both knew it, but neither has the courage or strength to address the underlying issue. So they continue to argue. 
               There was little doubt that the bridge was unsafe. All one had to do was look at it to know that with certainty. 
               Yet Bob didn't see another option. He may have been able to work one out if he had a bit of time to think things through, 
               but time was something he didn't have. A choice needed to be made, and it needed to be made quickly.

        <h2>Squid Game</h2>

            SEOUL—South Korea’s dystopian drama “Squid Game” might become Netflix's biggest hit ever.
            But for a decade, local studios rejected the fictionalized show’s pitch as too grotesque and too unrealistic.
            The premise revolves around financially broke adults playing traditional Korean children’s games on a secluded island. 
            The losers die. A single winner emerges with a cash prize of about $45 billion Korean won.
            Now “Squid Game,” which made its debut Sept. 17, is a global phenomenon. 
            TikTok videos of people replicating the children’s games have gone viral, 
            while online retailers are rushing to sell “Squid Game” Halloween costumes. 
            The show has hit No. 1 in more than 90 countries, including the U.S.—a surprise 
            even to Netflix executives.

            The popularity of “Squid Game” comes as Netflix faces unprecedented competition, 
            with rival streaming services seeking original hits that can grab eyeballs across
            continents to distinguish their offerings.
            “Squid Game” creator Hwang Dong-hyuk came up with the idea for the show more than a decade ago, 
            while living with his mother and grandmother. 
            He had to stop writing the script at one point: He was forced to sell his $675 laptop for cash.
